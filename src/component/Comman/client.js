We understand, however, that unexpected things can and do sometimes happen and while Gigzzy is not a party to the contract between you and any Home Service Professional we hope to help ensure your Gigzzy experience keeps you coming back. Accordingly, at Gigzzy, we voluntarily stand behind every job with the Gigzzy User Protection Plan, so you can be confident you're getting a high level of service at a great value. These Gigzzy User Protection Plan Terms set forth the benefits, eligibility requirements, and procedure for filing a claim under the Gigzzy User Protection Plan.</span></p><ol><li><strong>About the Gigzzy User Protection Plan</strong>. If you are not reasonably satisfied with the performance of the Home Service you have Requested through our Services, you may submit a claim (<strong>\"Claim\"</strong>) to us in accordance with these Gigzzy User Protection Plan Terms. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that your Claim meets all eligibility requirements (<strong>\"Eligibility Requirements\"</strong>) as provided herein, we may, in our sole discretion and pursuant to the terms provided herein, seek to fix the problem in a manner determined by us, which may include using the same or another Home Service Professional to attend the Premises and fix the problem, or otherwise reimbursing you for the Home Service Payment amount you have paid for the Home Service in kind or by applying credits redeemable towards future Home Services to your User Account.</li><li><strong>Eligibility Requirements</strong>. We reserve the right to review or consider only those Claims that meet all Eligibility Requirements provided herein and are under no obligation to review or consider a Claim or notify a Requesting User who has filed a Claim that does not meet the Eligibility Requirements as follows:</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>Gigzzy User Account and Compliance.</em>&nbsp;You must have a User Account with Gigzzy and must be and at all times during the claim process remain in full compliance with the General Terms of Service&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jiffyondemand.com/satisfaction_guarantee\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(3, 169, 244);\">https://gigzzy.com/terms</a>&nbsp;and the Gigzzy User Protection Plan Terms.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>Requested Through our Services.</em>&nbsp;You must have connected with the Home Service Professional with whom you contracted to provide the Home Service that is the subject of your Claim through our Services and your User Account. For clarity, any work done by a Home Service Professional that was performed as a result of contact or follow up with a Home Service Professional by phone, text, or otherwise without placing a Request is considered outside the scope of our Services. Your Claim will not be eligible for the Gigzzy User Protection Plan if you connected with a Home Service Professional outside our Services to provide any part of the Home Service that is the subject of your Claim.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>Performance of Home Service.</em>&nbsp;All work done pursuant to the Request that is the subject of your Claim must have been Requested by you while logged in to your User Account, Accepted by a Home Service Professional through our Services, and performed only by that Home Service Professional. If more than one Home Service Professional is required to complete the Home Service Requested, you or the originally contracted Home Service Professional must request additional Home Service Professionals through our Service. If, in connection with the Home Service underlying your Claim, you choose to hire or contract with additional worker(s) without making a Request through our Service, your Claim will not be eligible for the Gigzzy User Protection Plan.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>No Alterations or Modifications.</em>&nbsp;You must not alter or modify any parts, equipment, service or work provided by the Home Service Professional, except to the extent reasonably necessary to minimize damage to the Premises resulting from your Claim. If we determine, in our sole discretion, that you have materially altered or modified any of the work performed or parts or equipment provided by the Home Service Professional relating to your Claim and that your alteration or modification in any way contributed to the problem or issue, your Claim will not be eligible for the Gigzzy User Protection Plan.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>No Work or Recommendations Declined.</em>&nbsp;If, during the Job, the Home Service Professional makes reasonable recommendations to address the problem identified in the Request or Claim or any other problems that may have been discovered in the course of the performance of the Home Services (the&nbsp;<strong>\"Recommended Services\"</strong>) and you declined the Recommended Services, or any part thereof, your Claim will not be eligible for the Gigzzy User Protection Plan to the extent we determine, in our sole discretion, that the Recommended Services may have addressed part or all of your Claim.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>Payment for Home Service.</em>&nbsp;You must have paid in full for the Home Service that is the subject of your Claim. Your Claim will not be eligible for the Gigzzy User Protection Plan if you seek to stop payment for any Home Service, such as by contesting or refusing the related charge to your credit card.</li><li class=\"ql-indent-1\"><em>Claim Submitted Within Thirty Days.</em>&nbsp;If you choose to submit a Claim under the Gigzzy User Protection Plan, you must do so in accordance with the process described herein and within thirty (7) days after the last day of work performed as logged by the Home Service Professional on the Home Service. Any Claims filed after the 30 day deadline will not be eligible for the Gigzzy User Protection Plan.</li><li><strong>Filing and Processing a Claim.</strong>&nbsp;If you wish to file a Claim, you may email us at [admin@Gigzzy.com] and provide the following information: your name and address; a complete description of the Home Service Requested, work performed, and the problem arising therefrom; and, such other information or documentation (including photos) reasonably required to assess your Claim. Any discretion, review, determination, option, right, choice or decision exercisable by us hereunder and throughout the Claim process will be at our sole discretion, regardless of whether the phrase \"in our sole discretion\" is used or not. By filing a Claim, you agree to timely provide all additional information or documentation as we may reasonably request from time to time and represent and warrant to us that all information you provide during the Claim process is accurate, complete, and fairly represents the problem underlying your Claim. You further agree that we may, and authorize us to, share your Claim and any information you provide us in connection with the Claim with the applicable Home Service Professional. We reserve the right, to determine if the evidence you provide is reasonable and sufficient to process your Claim in accordance with these Gigzzy User Protection Plan Terms and to request additional information relating to your Claim at any time. You agree that your rights under the Gigzzy User Protection Plan will be subject to your providing us with all requested information. On a commercially reasonable efforts basis, we will address your problem as soon as reasonably practicable, but you acknowledge that it may take up to [<strong>six weeks</strong>] from the time you submit your Claim and all required documentation to complete resolution of your Claim. You agree that we will have no liability for any failure to resolve or make payment for your claim within this projected time period. Further, you understand and agree that if you fix or repair (or hire another service provider to fix or repair) any problem that resulted in the filing of your original Claim with us prior to us processing and resolving your Claim, your Claim will be automatically disqualified and you will be ineligible to receive any protection or payment from us for that Claim, unless such fix or repair was necessitated by exigent circumstances (such as loss of electricity or water, or water damage), as we so determine. When we receive your Claim, we will decide whether it is eligible for protection under the Gigzzy User Protection Plan (an&nbsp;<strong>\"Eligible Claim\"</strong>). If your Claim is an Eligible Claim, we will choose the appropriate resolution. We reserve the right to determine that your Claim is not an Eligible Claim and may, though are under no obligation to, notify you of your Claim's ineligibility by email to the email address you have provided in your User Account.</li><li><strong>Remedying Your Eligible Claim.</strong>&nbsp;If we decide that your Eligible Claim has merit, we may, in our sole discretion, attempt to remedy the problem by: by sending up to two (2) a Home Service Professionals to you at our expense; provide a credit to your User Account that you may put towards future Home Services; pay you the Home Service Payment amount you originally paid for the Home Service; or provide such other remedy or combination of remedies as we determine may fix or help fix the problem.

If we decide to remedy the problem or seek alternative estimates for repair of the problem, you agree that you will cooperate with such efforts, including providing access to the Premises, meeting with the Home Service Professional(s) identified by Gigzzy to correct the identified problem(s), and providing complete and accurate information to any necessary third party about the Home Service and your attempts to resolve the Claim. As we are under no obligation to remedy a problem arising out of a contract between you and the relevant Home Service Professional with whom you contracted, we reserve the right to remedy your Eligible Claim under the Gigzzy User Protection Plan, if at all, in the manner we determine, including by paying the Home Service Professional directly to fix the problem, by mailing you a check at your address provided in your User Account], or by otherwise crediting your User Account.</li><li><strong>Waiver and Release.</strong>&nbsp;You understand and agree that we are voluntarily offering the Gigzzy User Protection Plan and are under no obligation to do so under the Gigzzy Terms of Service or otherwise. Apart from these Gigzzy User Protection Plan Terms and our obligation to perform hereunder, if applicable, we have no obligation to provide you with protection under the Gigzzy User Protection Plan and any act on our part to do so is for the sole purpose of providing a satisfactory customer service to our Users. Any remedy or protection we may choose to provide to remedy your Eligible Claim under the Gigzzy User Protection Plan, if at all, is subject to your execution of a waiver and release (<strong>\"Waiver and Release\"</strong>) in the form we provide to you. In this Waiver and Release you understand and agree that you will waive, release, and forever discharge us from and against any and all manner of liabilities, claims, demands, suits, damages (including direct, indirect, special, punitive, incidental and consequential damages), costs, expenses, debts, actions and causes of action of any kind or nature whatsoever related to or arising from the Claim.</li><li><strong>Recourse from Home Service Professional.</strong>&nbsp;The Gigzzy User Protection Plan is a voluntary offer from us and in no way restricts the limits and exclusions provided in our General Terms of Service, or changes or expands the role of our Service as a platform to connect Requesting Users with Home Service Professionals. We in no way accept responsibility for any work performed by a Home Service Professional and expressly disclaim any liability under a Requesting User's agreement with a Home Service Professional. Filing a Claim under the Gigzzy User Protection Plan in no way restricts your ability to seek a recourse directly from the Home Service Professional with whom you contracted for the Job.</li><li><strong>Termination of Plan and Effect of Amendment.</strong>&nbsp;We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to terminate the Gigzzy User Protection Plan at any time without notice. Any such termination will not affect the availability of the Gigzzy User Protection Plan for Home Services Requested prior to such termination, but will be effective going forward as of the time the Gigzzy User Protection Plan was terminated. If we choose to amend these Gigzzy User Protection Terms under the Amendments section of the General Terms of Service, we will post the revised Gigzzy User Protection Plan Terms on this page at Gigzzy.com&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gigzzy.com/satisfaction_guarantee\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: windowtext;\">https://gigzzy.com/clientsatisfaction</a><u style=\"color: rgb(3, 169, 244);\">commitment </u>, and we will indicate at the bottom of such page the date of the last revision or modification.
