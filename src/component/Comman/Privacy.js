We know how important it is to protect your personal information and want to make every customer experience as safe and secure as reasonably possible. In keeping with that goal, we have developed this Policy to explain our practices for the collection, use, storage and disclosure of your personal information</li><li><em><u>Personal Information</u></em></li><li class="ql-indent-1">For the purposes of this Policy,&nbsp;<strong>"personal information"</strong>&nbsp;means information about an identifiable individual, including, for example, an individual\'s name, home address, telephone number, social security number, sex, income and family status. Personal information does not include information that would enable an individual to be contacted at a place of business, for example an employee\'s name, position or title, business telephone number, or business address. We will only collect, use, store or disclose personal information in accordance with this Policy, or in accordance with laws applicable to the collection, use and disclosure of your personal information by us (<strong>"ApplicableLegalLaws"</strong>).</li><li><em><u>Non-Personal Information</u></em></li><li class="ql-indent-1">On the other hand,&nbsp;<strong>"non-personal information"</strong>&nbsp;is any type of information other than personal information, and is excluded from this Policy. For example, non-personal information would include business information, or information that enables an individual to be contacted at a place of business, for example an employee\'s name, position or title, business telephone number, or business address. Non-personal information also includes information that is anonymous or not about an identifiable individual, such as web browsing information (such as the domain used to access the Website, or the type and version of device, browser or operating system being used to access the Service), or aggregate information that anonymizes the underlying data (like the number of visitors, what pages users visit, average time spent on the Website or on various parts of the Service). We will collect, use, store or disclose non-personal information in accordance with our ordinary business practices and in our discretion, but always in accordance with any ApplicableLegalLaws.</li><li><em><u>Information about Minors</u></em></li><li class="ql-indent-1">The Website is not intended for minors and no person under the age of majority may register for a User Account. We do not knowingly collect personal information about any person under the age of majority (usually the age of 18 or 19, but it varies in different jurisdictions) including any person under the age of 13, and no such person, nor any parent or guardian on behalf of such person, should submit their personal information to us for any reason. Please do not submit personal information about minors to us, whether through the Website, the Service or otherwise. If a parent or guardian of a minor who is under 13 years of age discovers that the minor\'s personal information has been submitted to us without the parent\'s or guardian\'s consent, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to delete all such information in our possession or under our control at the parent\'s or guardian\'s request. To request the removal of personal information of a minor who is under 13 years of age, a parent or guardian must contact theLegalOfficer as set forth below and provide all information requested by theLegalOfficer to assist in identifying the information to be deleted.</li><li><em><u>Privacy Officer</u></em></li><li class="ql-indent-1">We have appointed a Legal Officer who is responsible for our compliance with this Policy. All complaints, questions and requests for additional information regarding this Policy should be promptly submitted to the Legal Officer. Information on how to contact&nbsp;theLegal Officer can be found below.</li><li><strong>Collection and Use of Personal Information</strong></li><li>As indicated above, we collect two types of information through our Service: personal information and non-personal information. The types of information we collect about you will depend on the nature of your interaction with us or the Service.</li><li><em><u>Information we collect from you</u></em></li><li class="ql-indent-1">We may collect the following personal information from you:</li></ol><ul><li class="ql-indent-2">contact information such as name, email address, mailing address, phone number;</li><li class="ql-indent-2">billing information such as credit card number, and billing address;</li><li class="ql-indent-2">unique identifiers such as user name, account number, password;</li><li class="ql-indent-2">photograph uploaded as a profile picture;</li><li class="ql-indent-2">professional information including licences, qualifications, training, certificates, insurance, and tax related information;</li><li class="ql-indent-2">user content generated by you, such as audio, video, text and images as provided by you on the Website, which may contain personal information as provided by you;</li><li class="ql-indent-2">preferences information such as Request history and marketing preferences; and</li><li class="ql-indent-2">any information that you voluntarily enter, including personal information, into any postings, comments, reviews, or forums with Gigzzy.</li></ul><ol><li><em><u>Information we automatically collect</u></em></li><li class="ql-indent-1">We also automatically gather information about your computer such as your IP address, browser type, referring/exit pages, operating system, as well as which aspects of our performance metric indicators available with our technology or our licensees\' products you prefer using. Some of this may be personal information, but in typical cases it is non-personal information. Specific examples follow:</li></ol><ul><li class="ql-indent-2">IP, etc.—When using our Website, we may collect the Internet Protocol (IP) address of your computer, the IP address of your Internet Service Provider, the date and time you access our Website, the Internet address of the website from which you linked directly to our Website, the operating system you are using, the sections of our Website you visit, the Website pages and images viewed, and the content you download from the Website. This information is used for Website and system administration purposes, and to improve the Website.</li><li class="ql-indent-2">Cookies—We use&nbsp;<strong>"cookies"</strong>, a technology that installs a small amount of information on a user\'s computer to permit the Website to recognize future visits using that computer. Cookies enhance the convenience and use of the Website. For example, the information provided through cookies is used to recognize you as a previous user of the Website, to offer personalized content and information for your use, to track your activity at the Website, to respond to your needs, and to otherwise facilitate your Website experience. You may choose to decline cookies if your browser permits, but doing so may affect your use of the Website and your ability to access certain features of the Website or engage in transactions through the Website.</li><li class="ql-indent-2">Geo-Location Information—When you use the Service through a mobile device, we may track or collect your geo-location information on a real time basis only. We may also use this real-time geo-location information to address support, technical, or business issues that may arise in the course of your use of the Service. If you do not consent to the tracking of your geo-location, you may still be able to use some features of the Service, but it is intended to be used with geo-location information. For example, Home Service Professionals will enter their start location and throughout their trip to the Premises. You may at any time withdraw your consent as permitted through the Service, or, provided you are not a Home Service Professional, you can turn the geo-location tracking off at the device level as permitted by the manufacturer of your device. In our experience, your mobile device may inform you when geo-location is tracked by displaying the GPS arrow icon.</li></ul><ol><li><strong>Use of Personal Information</strong></li><li>We may use your personal information, in combination with your non-personal information, for a variety of business purposes, for example to:</li></ol><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fulfill your Request;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send you a Request confirmation, if applicable;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send you requested Home Service or Job information;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send new product or service information;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond to customer service requests;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;administer your User Account;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send you a newsletter;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;carry out contests or promotions;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;send you marketing communications;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond to your questions and concerns;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;improve our Services and marketing efforts;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conduct research and analysis;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to enforce our Terms of Service;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;display content based upon your interests;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for distribution to our Payment Processor for the provision of payment services;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;facilitate your transactions with other Users or Home Service Professionals, as applicable;</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;transfer to a third party purchasing all or substantially all of our assets</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to improve the Services; and</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for other purposes as described in this Policy or contemplated by the Terms of Service.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">Your Consent</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"> We will collect, use, store or disclose your personal information only with your knowledge and consent, except where required or permitted by Applicable Legal Laws. When you choose to provide us with your personal information you consent to the use of your personal information as identified in this Policy and as may be further identified at the time of collection.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"><u>Express Consent</u></em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"> Sometimes you will be asked to give your express consent to our collection, use, storage or disclosure of personal information – for example, by being asked to check a box to indicate your consent to receive marketing communications.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"><u>Implied Consent</u></em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"> Other times, you may provide your implied consent to our collection, use or disclosure of personal information when we can reasonably conclude that you have given consent by some action you have taken or an action you have decided not to take. Generally, this occurs where the purpose for the use of your personal information would be reasonably apparent to you – for example, when you provide us with your address through your Request forms while placing a Request, you provide us with implied consent to use that address in order to fulfill your order. If you choose to make any aspects of your user profile public on the Service, you are giving implied consent for other users to view and use that personal information.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"><u>Withdrawing Your Consent</u></em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"> You may notify us at any time that you wish to withdraw or change your consent to our use and disclosure or your personal information. We will accommodate your request subject to legal, technical and contractual restrictions. The most common way of indicating this withdrawal of consent is (i) by changing your Legal preferences to the extent such functionality is made available through the Service, or (ii) deleting your account with the Service and stopping use of the Service. In other situations, you may be able to opt out of the use of your personal information. For example, if you have "opted in" or subscribed to one of our mailing lists, we will always provide you the opportunity to "opt out" or unsubscribe. For example, if you receive emails from us, we will usually provide a link in the email which you can use to unsubscribe from that mailing list, or you may contact us at&nbsp;</span><a href="mailto:info@Gigzzy.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">info@Gigzzy.com</a><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">. You may also choose not to provide us with your personal information. However, if you make this choice we may not be able to provide you with the Service, or information that you have requested. For example, we require your email address in order to verify your User Account, which is necessary so that notifications may be sent to you electronically.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">Information Obtained from Third Parties</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"> If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will only use that in accordance with this Policy or any other such Legal policy under which that information was collected.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">Disclosure and Sharing of Your Information</strong></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"> We will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Policy. Unless we sell to a third party all or substantially all of our assets, we will not sell your personal information to third parties, however the use of our Service necessarily requires some sharing or disclosure of your personal information. Some of these activities may result in personal information collected by us being stored or processed in the Kenya or elsewhere outside of Kenya and, as a result, your personal information may be accessible to law enforcement and regulatory authorities in accordance with the Kenya information Act and other applicable laws of the Kenya or elsewhere.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><em style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"><u>Third Party Processors</u></em></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);"> We may provide your personal information to companies that provide services to help us with the Service such as web hosting providers, payment processors, product shipping providers, fulfilment agencies, or customer service agencies (</span><strong style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">"Third Party Processors"</strong><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">). These Third Party Processors are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to us, and in a manner consistent with this Policy. We have attempted to select Third Party Processors who will only use your information in compliance with this Policy, but we have no control over, or liability for, their own specific policies regarding the collection, use, storage and disclosure of personal information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to identify such Third Party Processors when we are collecting your personal information, as well as providing links to the relevant Legal policies that may apply. Here are some examples of the Third Party Processors we use as part of the Service:</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">§&nbsp;Our Service is currently physically hosted b amazon AWS Inc., a reputable hosting platform with industry standard security and practices.</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">§&nbsp;We do not directly process payments through our Service. We use Stripe and Mpesa&nbsp;and their Legal terms are available here: https://stripe.com/ca/privacy. We only ourselves collect and store limited parts of that information to provide a record of your transaction and to prevent fraud (such as a part of a credit card number, or a part of your billing address).</span></p><p><span style="color: rgb(66, 66, 66);">§&nbsp;When you enter into a Request for a Job through the Service, we forward certain aspects of the information you provide to the relevant Home Service Professional and Stripe to enable them to assist in performing parts of the Service.
